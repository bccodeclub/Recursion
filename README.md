# Recursion
### Starter:
Create an algorithm which creates a fibonacci number.
The sequence is 

n | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- 
f | 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 5 | 8 | 13

Make an algorithm which:
Inputs a n value and output the corresponding f value.

### What is recursion?
Recursion is a function which calls upon itself. It splits the problem up into a simpler problem and when the problem gets simple enough, we solve the problem.

**An example of this is in fibonacci numbers:** We know that each fibonacci number is the sum of it and the number before it. Therefore, if we create a function which finds the nth fibonacci in the sequence. f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2). The function calls upon itself as you see. when n = 1 or n = 0, we return 1, as we know that the 1st and 0th fibonacci number is 1. If not, then we call the function again.
